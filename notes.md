## Notes

PRE_SETTLEMENT_REVIEW can be avoided or not. Technicall it shoud be since payment not made and definition of void is to cancel or stop payment that has not been made

No checks specified if refund amount is more than payment amount, but we have implemented it

# THINGS I WOULD DO DIFFERENTLY

Have an event log that records all transitions like a transactions with timestamp
Persists data instead of storing in just memory
